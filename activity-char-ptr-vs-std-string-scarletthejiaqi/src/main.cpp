  // Q1: Can anyone guess why we needed a const before the char*

  // Q2: How can I print out a std::string on the console?

  //Q3: How can I print out a const char*

  //Q4: How can I print out a char array

  //Q5: Hmm, can I set a static char array as a std::string? How about the other way around?

  //Q6: Hmm, can I also set a static char array as a char ptr? How about the other way around?

  //Q7: How would I iterate through a std::string

  //Q8: How would I do the same for const char * 

  //Q9: How would I do the same for char[]

  //Q10: What happens if I dereference my const char ptr?

  //Q11: How would I change an element in the std::string

  //Q12: How would I change an element in the const char*?

  //Q13: How would I change an element in the char array?

  //Q14: What would happen if you added the terminating character somewhere in the middle of the char array

  //Q15: What would happen if you added the terminating character somewhere in the middle of the std::string

  //follow-up to Q14-15: how is iterating over these strings different now?
  //follow-up to Q14-15: how does the null-terminating character "count" in terms of string length?
